# Prepaid Fraud Intelligence Dashboard
Prepaid Fraud Intelligence Dashboard for Real Time Fraud Detection

An advanced, interactive dashboard designed to monitor, investigate, and resolve prepaid telecom fraud using simulated Generative and Agentic AI features. This project was built to showcase a modern, AI-powered interface for fraud analysts.

âœ¨ Key Features
This dashboard is packed with interactive and AI-driven features to provide a comprehensive fraud management experience:

Dynamic Main Dashboard:

AI Insights & Focus Area: Real-time, AI-generated summaries of critical threats and predictive focus areas.

Interactive Charts: Visualizations for "Fraudulent Activity Trends" and "Alerts by Risk Level" powered by Chart.js.

AI BIN Analysis: A dedicated card to show AI-driven analysis of Bank Identification Numbers.

Recent Suspicious Activity Table:

"Ask AI" Natural Language Search: Query the data table using plain English (e.g., "show high risk sim swaps").

Advanced Filtering: Filter activities by type in combination with the AI search.

AI Assistant Modal:

Dynamic Risk Explanation: Get context-aware, AI-generated explanations for why an alert was triggered.

Dynamic Recommended Actions: Receive a tailored list of next steps based on the specific fraud type.

Agentic AI Workflow Simulation:

Engage an AI agent to autonomously investigate and resolve a case.

Watch a step-by-step log of the agent's "thoughts," "actions," and "responses" as it interacts with simulated internal systems (MCP Servers).

Predictive Threat Simulation:

Run "what-if" scenarios for different threat vectors (e.g., Phishing, Zero-Day Exploit) to see the predicted financial impact.

Interactive Reporting & Management:

Create PDF Reports: Generate and download a professional PDF report of the currently filtered data.

Manage Dashboards: A modal to simulate loading and managing different dashboard views.

ðŸš€ How to Run
This is a self-contained prototype with no build process required.

Download: Save the prepaid_fraud_dashboard.html file to your local machine.

Open: Open the file directly in a modern web browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge.

Internet Connection: An active internet connection is required to load the external libraries (Tailwind CSS, Chart.js, etc.) from their respective CDNs.

ðŸ¤– Highlighting the Gen AI Capabilities
This dashboard simulates several cutting-edge AI features to demonstrate the future of fraud analysis:

Natural Language Processing (NLP): The "Ask AI" search bar uses NLU to understand user intent, entities (fraud types), and modifiers (risk levels), making data exploration intuitive and powerful.

Natural Language Generation (NLG): The AI Insights card and the Risk Explanation feature in the AI Assistant use NLG to translate complex data and model outputs into clear, human-readable text.

Predictive Analytics: The AI Focus Area and Predictive Threat Simulation features are driven by simulated machine learning models that forecast future trends and potential financial losses, enabling a proactive approach to fraud management.

Explainable AI (XAI): The "Explain the Risk" feature is a practical application of XAI. It demystifies the AI's decision-making process by breaking down a complex risk score into understandable components, which is crucial for building analyst trust.

Agentic AI Workflows: The "Engage AI Agent" feature simulates an autonomous AI agent. It showcases a "chain of thought" where the agent can plan, use tools (simulate API calls to internal systems), and execute actions to resolve a case from start to finish, providing a transparent log of its entire process.
